A simple MATLAB code for a typical introductory CFD problem: Calculating the temperature distribution over a flat plate with given temperature boundary conditions (Dirichlet Boundary Conditions). Interior of plate is divided into a 3x3 grid and the 1D heat equation was used to solve at the grid points using finite difference methods.
